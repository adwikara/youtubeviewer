# Youtube Viewer Bot

## Overview
This is a small project that was supposed to slowly grow the total view hours of my Dota 2 youtube channel. However, YouTube detects selenium and doesn't allow me to login, so I figured it probably doesn't count the views as well. Regardless, the code will open a browser and switch to different links for a desired amount of time.

*At the end, I realized that the views didn't really ended up counting :D
